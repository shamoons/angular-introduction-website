============================

Quick demo to show off AngularJS's awesomeness. Uses an `express` server to serve on port 1234. After cloning, run

`npm install`

If you don't have coffeescript, you should get it globally via `npm install -g coffee-script`.

Once that's done, just type `coffee server.coffee` and you're up and running!
